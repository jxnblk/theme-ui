# Design Graph

The core organizing principle for styles in Theme UI is based
on a conceptual model called the *Design Graph*.

The Design Graph is composed of the following nodes:

- **Scales** are limited collections of raw values that map to specific style properties.
  For example, values for `font-size` are stored in the `fontSizes` scale.
- **Components** are elements that have styles constrained by *scales*.
- **Variants** are partial styles that map to specific components.
  For example, a button might have *primary* and *secondary* variants, or *large* and *small* variants.
- **Themes** are collections of *scales* (and possibly *variants*) that encapsulate a particular visual design language.
  Ideally, themes follow a common interface (or schema) and can be swapped out in different implementations.

The Design Graph provides a way to think and talk about the styles in Theme UI,
and the [Theme Specification][] is the primary interface for theme objects.
