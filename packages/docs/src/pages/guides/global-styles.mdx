# Global Styles

Use the Emotion `Global` component to add global CSS with theme-based values.

By default, the `ThemeProvider` component will apply styles in `theme.styles.root` to the `<html>` element.
It will also apply `color` and `background-color` styles based on `theme.colors.text` and `theme.colors.background` respectively.

<Note>
  Generally, you should try to avoid adding CSS to global scope. Many styles can
  be safely encapsulated into a component without the need for global styles.
</Note>

```jsx
import { Global } from '@emotion/react'

export default (props) => (
  <Global
    styles={(theme) => ({
      '*': {
        boxSizing: 'border-box',
      },
    })}
  />
)
```

<Note>

  If you are upgrading from a version of theme-ui older that v0.6.0, be aware the import
  package has changed from `@emotion/core` to `@emotion/react`. For more information see
  the [Migration Notes for 0.6](https://theme-ui.com/migrating/#breaking-changes).
